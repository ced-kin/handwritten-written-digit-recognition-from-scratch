# handwritten-written-digit-recognition-from-scratch
The goal of this project was to produce a functioning neural network without using any frameworks

## Structure
The network contains fully connected layers in the following arrangement: 784-256-64-10  
The network takes a 28x28 grayscale image as input

## Use
To use the pygame application launch the drawnumber.py script. To make another neural network delete the nndata.npz file, open networkcontroller.py, uncomment the 3 lines of the forloop and run the networkcontroller.py script.

## Result
A neural network made from scratch that achieves 94% accuracy on the mnist dataset.
